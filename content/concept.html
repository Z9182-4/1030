            <p>There are various types of information security threats today. Common ones include software attacks, intellectual property theft, identity theft, device or data theft, sabotage, and information extortion. For instance, software attacks encompass viruses, worms, phishing attacks, and Trojan horses. Intellectual property theft poses significant challenges for many IT businesses. Identity theft involves impersonating others, often by acquiring their personal information or exploiting opportunities through social engineering. With the prevalence of mobile devices, theft of devices or information has become more common, particularly as data volumes increase.</p>

            <p>Phishing, a type of social engineering scam, involves attackers deceiving individuals into divulging sensitive information or installing malware like ransomware. These attacks have grown in sophistication, often mimicking targeted sites seamlessly, enabling attackers to monitor user activity and bypass additional security measures undetected. Common types of phishing includes:</p>

            <p>Malware, an umbrella term for malicious software, refers to any software intentionally designed to disrupt computers, servers, clients, or computer networks, leak private information, gain unauthorized access to information or systems, deprive access to information, or interfere with users' computer security and privacy without their knowledge. Researchers tend to categorize malware into one or more subtypes, such as </p>

            <h2 id="cryptography"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_security#Cryptography">Cryptography</a></h2>
            <p>Information security employs cryptography to convert usable information into an unreadable format, making it inaccessible to unauthorized users; this procedure is known as encryption. Encrypted information can be reverted to its original form by an authorized user possessing the cryptographic key, a process termed decryption. Cryptography serves as a safeguard in information security, shielding data from unintended or unauthorized disclosure during transmission (electronically or physically) and while stored.</p>

            <p>Cybercrime has been consistently escalating year after year. What accounts for this surge? Here are several contributing factors:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Cybercrime is straightforward to execute.</li>
                    <li>The risk of detection and apprehension is minimal.</li>
                    <li>Even with minimal effort, cybercriminals often reap substantial rewards.</li>
                    <li>Attackers have the capability to target a vast number of victims simultaneously.</li>
                    <li>The advent of cryptocurrencies has streamlined money laundering practices.</li>
                </ul>
            <p>Challenges such as identity theft can profoundly impact individuals, resulting not only in potential financial losses but also significant personal distress.</p>
