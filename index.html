            <h2>Cyber Crimes</h2>
            <p>Cybercrime has been consistently escalating year after year. What accounts for this surge? Here are several contributing factors:
                <ul>
                    <li>Cybercrime is straightforward to execute.</li>
                    <li>The risk of detection and apprehension is minimal.</li>
                    <li>Even with minimal effort, cybercriminals often reap substantial rewards.</li>
                    <li>Attackers have the capability to target a vast number of victims simultaneously.</li>
                    <li>The advent of cryptocurrencies has streamlined money laundering practices.</li>
                </ul>
                Challenges such as identity theft can profoundly impact individuals, resulting not only in potential financial losses but also significant personal distress
